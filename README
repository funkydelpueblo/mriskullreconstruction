Final project for WUSTL CSE 554A
=================================

ABOUT
---------------------------------
This project aims to allow for quick construction of a 
3-D model for the upper part of a human skull, with minimal
and basic user interaction required, based solely on
MRI imaging (as opposed to a CT scan). It was developed
for Dr. Tao Ju's "Geometric Computing for Bioscience"
class at Washington University in St. Louis. 


REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------
This project depends on 4 libraries:
* JAI codec (for TIFF image writing)
* MigLayout (for GUI)
* VecMath
* OpenCV Java 3.0.0

These four libraries must be referenced, and it is likely
necessary to include the native bindings for OpenCV.
